Teb Local Planner
##################

This package implements an online optimal local trajectory planner for navigation and control of mobile robots as a plugin for the ROS navigation package. The initial trajectory generated by a global planner is optimized during runtime w.r.t. minimizing the trajectory execution time (time-optimal objective), separation from obstacles and compliance with kinodynamic constraints such as satisfying maximum velocities and accelerations.
