Teb Local Planner
##################

This package implements an online optimal local trajectory planner for navigation and control of mobile robots as a plugin for the ROS navigation package. The initial trajectory generated by a global planner is optimized during runtime w.r.t. minimizing the trajectory execution time, separation from obstacles and compliance with kinodynamic constraints such as satisfying maximum velocities and accelerations. 

The optimal trajectory is efficiently obtained by solving a sparse scalarized multi-objective optimization problem. The user can provide weights to the optimization problem in order to specify the behavior in case of conflicting objectives.
