SLAM Implementation
#####################

In this section, we will look at how we implemented the SLAM in our project.

Mapping
********
Gmapping, which was used in this project, is a laser-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) algorithm that builds a 2d map.
It uses laser scan data and odometry data from the robot to feed a highly efficient Rao-Blackwellized particle filer to learn grid maps from laser range data.
The laser scan is generated by taking the point cloud from the 3D sensor and grabbing points from an “eye-level” prespective of the robot. It does not use any RGB data, or any full depth data.

The package contains a node called slam_gmapping.

The basic hardware requirement for doing SLAM is a laser scanner which is horizontally mounted on the top of the robot, and the robot odometry data. In this robot, we have already satisfied these requirements. We can generate the 2D map of the environment, using the gmapping package through the following procedure.

Before operating with Gmapping, we need to install it using the following command
